# Group_3

### Team project of group 3: TC & DYC

## A brief on the code

### 1. Content
    - Implementation of ideas in the report.
    - Illustration of collaborative Back-propagation networks.
    - Demonstration of the results by matplotlib on python.

### 2. Guide to run
    - Run the python source code files. (with Maruti- and Estate-)
    - They will show up figures of loss function trends.
    - The other codes are backups and should not be run.
    - Datasets are provided but should be protected from other uses.
